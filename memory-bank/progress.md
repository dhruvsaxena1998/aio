# Progress

## Current Status

- **Memory Bank Initialization**: The Memory Bank has been initialized with core files that document the project context and progress.
  - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`: Core requirements and goals.
  - `memory-bank/productContext.md`: Product purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals.
  - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`: System architecture, design patterns, and component relationships.
  - `memory-bank/techContext.md`: Technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, and project insights.

## Known Issues

- **None Identified**: As of now, there are no known issues with the project setup or documentation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Technology Stack**: Chosen Go for backend development, PostgreSQL for database management, and JWT for authentication.
- **Architecture**: Followed the MVC pattern with adjustments for API nature.
- **Containerization**: Decided to use Docker for containerization and CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Update Memory Bank**: Ensure all files are accurate and up-to-date.
2. **Start Implementing API Endpoints**: Begin developing the core functionality of the Habit Tracking API.
3. **Set Up Database Schema**: Define and implement the database schema for user and habit data.
4. **Implement Authentication**: Develop JWT-based authentication for secure user management.
5. **Develop Core Handlers**: Create handlers for user registration, login, habit management, and completion tracking.
6. **Testing and Validation**: Implement thorough testing to ensure the API is reliable and secure.
7. **Containerization and CI/CD**: Set up Docker containers and CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
