# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This is a AIO (All in One) Project, that aims to provide multiple solutions.

The `Routine` aka Habit Tracking API aims to provide a simple and efficient way for users to manage their habits and track their progress. By offering a RESTful API, developers can integrate habit tracking functionality into their applications, helping users to form and maintain good habits.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Habit Formation**: Users often struggle to form and maintain habits. A structured API can provide the tools needed to consistently track and manage habits.
2. **Integration**: Developers can integrate habit tracking into existing applications, enhancing user engagement and providing additional value.
3. **Data Management**: Centralized data management ensures that user data is stored securely and can be accessed easily.

## How It Should Work

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register and log in to the API using secure authentication methods.
2. **Habit Management**: Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete habits.
3. **Completion Tracking**: Users can track when they complete their habits, with the API providing insights and analytics.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Ease of Use**: The API should be intuitive and easy to use for both developers and end-users.
2. **Reliability**: The API should be reliable and provide consistent performance.
3. **Security**: User data should be protected, and authentication should be secure.
