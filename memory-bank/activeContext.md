# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- **Initialize Memory Bank**: Create and populate the Memory Bank with core files to document the project context and progress.

## Recent Changes

- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` to define core requirements and goals.
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md` to describe the product's purpose, problems it solves, and user experience goals.
- Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to outline the system architecture, design patterns, and component relationships.
- Created `memory-bank/techContext.md` to list technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.

## Next Steps

1. **Create `memory-bank/progress.md`**: Document the current status, known issues, and evolution of project decisions.
2. **Review and Update Memory Bank**: Ensure all files are accurate and up-to-date.
3. **Start Implementing API Endpoints**: Begin developing the core functionality of the Habit Tracking API.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Technology Stack**: Chosen Go for backend development, PostgreSQL for database management, and JWT for authentication.
- **Architecture**: Followed the MVC pattern with adjustments for API nature.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for containerization and CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Code Organization**: Follow a modular approach with clear separation of concerns.
- **Security**: Prioritize secure authentication and data protection.
- **Performance**: Ensure the API is performant and scalable.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation to ensure clarity and ease of maintenance.
- **Testing**: Implement thorough testing to catch issues early in the development process.
